One of them is MongoDB.\nSo what is MongoDB?\nMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s. It falls under the category of a NoSQL database. Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax to store and retrieve data for further insights. Instead, a NoSQL database system encompasses a wide range of database technologies that can store structured, semi-structured, unstructured and polymorphic data.\nWhat is NoSQL?\nNoSQL is a non-relational database that does not require a fixed schema,avoid joins and is easy to scale. NoSQL database stands for \u0026ldquo;Not Only SQL\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Not SQL.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy NoSQL?\nStructured SQL is difficult to scale as database grows. Unstructured databases do not need to follow predefined format.\nThere are several ways of installing MongoDB on the machine.\n I have chose to install them using HomeBrew and largely uses Command Line to interact with MongoDB. There are some things you may need to watch out like Os version of your Mac. You may wish to follow this installation guide. This guide makes it easy to understand and follow like creating a connection on local machine. There is also another way which is to install MongoDB Compass on the local machine. You may wish to follow this guide.  Python with MongoDB In python, in order to connect to MongoDB, we will need a package call PyMongo. Assuming installation is done correctly, now we will move on to Python to connect to our database. MongoDB works in the key value pair metholody.\nBelow snippet is the basic of connecting to the database.

This is because MongoDB does not show any empty databases. We will need to insert arbitrary data into the collection.\ntestInsert=mytable.insert_one({\u0026quot;country\u0026quot;:'India'}).inserted_id  We can also use pandas to load a csv and transform into MongoDB.\ndf=pd.read_csv('sampleMongoData.csv') #create empty array listofDocs=[] for i in df.index: listofDocs.append(dict(df.iloc[i])) myfinal = mytable.insert_many(listofDocs)  Reading from MongoDB and transfer to a dataframe\n# transfering to dataframe sample=table.find() df=pd.DataFrame(sample) df.head()  Inserting mutliple observations into MongoDB\nmport datetime new_posts = [{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;newMike\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;username\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;latestpost!\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;: datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 12, 11, 14)}, {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Eliot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;onceAgain\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;and pretty easy too!\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;: datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 10, 10, 45)}] final = mytable.insert_many(new_posts) final.inserted_ids  Upon successful data entry, this will be shown.\n[ObjectId('5e8c2ebc6057435b48b52886'), ObjectId('5e8c2ebc6057435b48b52887')]  Filtering entry\nIn order to filter an entry of document, you will need to use find_one method\nmytable.find_one({\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:'Same'})  Delete entry\nTo delete entry, you will just need to use delete_one method\nmytable.delete_one({'name':'Mike'})  Update entry\nTo update entry, you will to use the update_one method\nmyquery = { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Valley 345\u0026quot; } newvalues = { \u0026quot;$set\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Canyon 123\u0026quot; } } mytable.update_one(myquery, newvalues)  Conclusion I hope the resources and this post willl be able to show you the basics of MongoDB and how you can try to integrate Python with MongoDB.\nReferences  https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/mongodb-in-python-tutorial-for-beginners-using-pymongo/ https://www.guru99.com/create-read-update-operations-mongodb.html https://zellwk.com/blog/install-mongodb/  ","date":1586399225,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586399225,"objectID":"3ec06bbe5feb4d220fefc242ee682192","permalink":"/post/9apr/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T10:27:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/9apr/","section":"post","summary":"In the midst of looking for a job in such situation, I took some time to pick up new knowledge which I think it's useful. One of them is MongoDB.\nSo what is MongoDB?\nMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s. It falls under the category of a NoSQL database. Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax to store and retrieve data for further insights.","tags":[],"title":"Accessing MongoDb with Pymongo","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Hotel Pal: A Content-based recommender I will be sharing my thoughts about the project, the challenges I have faced and after thoughts of this project.\nObjective As part of GA curriculum, I built a end-to-end content based recommender engine, deployment on Heroku via Flask. The objective is to transform implicit information provided by users into explicit features for hotel recommendation system engine. There are two parts to this recommender engine using hotel attributes and reviews by users respectively to build two separate recommendation engine.\nExecutive Summary In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).\nThere are two main data selection methods:\nCollaborative-filtering: In collaborative-filtering items are recommended, for example hotels, based on how similar your user profile is to other users’, finds the users that are most similar to you and then recommends items that they have shown a preference for. This method suffers from the so-called cold-start problem: If there is a new hotel, no-one else would’ve yet liked or watched it, so you’re not going to have this in your list of recommended hotels, even if you’d love it.\nContent-based filtering: This method uses attributes of the content to recommend similar content. It doesn’t have a cold-start problem because it works through attributes or tags of the content, such as views, Wi-Fi or room types, so that new hotels can be recommended right away.\nThe point of content-based is that we have to know the content of both user and item. Usually you construct user-profile and item-profile using the content of shared attribute space. For example, for a movie, you represent it with the movie stars in it and the genres (using a binary coding for example).\nThere are a number of popular encoding schemes but the main ones are:\n One-hot encoding Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding Word embeddings  In this project, we will be discussing content-based filtering of recommender engine, turning implicit attributes into explicit features for hotel recommender engine.\nDetails can be found on my github repo.\nMy thought process I would like to share my experience in terms of the process of this capstone. As a beginner in data science project, the first challenge I have faced was selecting the appropriate topic to work on and capturing the end goal of the project.\n  Being objective and selecting a digestible topic within timeline\nWith given about 4-5 weeks timeline, I took consideration of choosing a topic which I could complete on time. Since I was always interested about how Netflix throws us recomendations of movies/shows we might like, I zoomed into looking at recommender systems. The recommender was introduced as part of unsupervised machine learning techniques in the course around week 7-8, so I have sufficient time to read up and do my research on building recommender engine. It took me around 2-3 weeks to settle in on a topic which I want to work on and how my project demostration will look like. The difficult part is to conceptualise how the demostration will look like, what information to use and illustrate on.\n  Goals of project\nI also took consideration of building a demo as part of my consideration for the project. Because with the aid of demo, it will be helpful for my audience to understand what I am trying to deliver. From project managment perspective, I inked down the various timeline I need to meet in order the final deadline. I also evaluated the difficulty of each task, giving more time for deployment since it was my first time deploying on Flask and using Heroku. Base on my experience on deployment when i was doing my Graduate Diploma, the deployment is the phase where I did a lot of self reading and debugging.\n  Technical perspect of the project\nOne of the key issues which I faced initially when I was writing the code to compile a sparse matrix and tabulating a cosine-similar matrix was computation power. My current MacBook has only 8gb Ram and some codes takes a bit of computation power. I explored Google Colab and Sagemaker, and as recommended by TA, AWS Sagemaker is so much efficient and easy to use. It has exactly the same user interface as jupyter notebook. Moreover, the better computation specifications is not really costly as long as you remember to turn off the instance after usage. 3-4 hours of a ml.t2.2xlarge (32gb ram) cost me about 3-4 USD.\nIn the deployment phase, there are guides available online and it is really useful. One of the website which i followed diligently is this article. I felt that the most challenging part was the http protocols, GET and POST requests and how information are passed through these requests. Fortunately, I have tapped on my past experience in software development to build the site. I have considered using a docker and host in AWS but utlimately my application is not intensive. I felt Heroku works for me now and it's free anyway.\nLooking back This journey was really interesting. I learnt to look at problems in a different perspective and building an end-to end solution needs to go through a lot more thought process. I tried different technology and see how it work or did not work for me.\n  ","date":1585534986,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585534986,"objectID":"4823336d5a948a9c0184109f79b839e8","permalink":"/post/30mar/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T10:23:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/30mar/","section":"post","summary":"Hotel Pal: A Content-based recommender I will be sharing my thoughts about the project, the challenges I have faced and after thoughts of this project.\nObjective As part of GA curriculum, I built a end-to-end content based recommender engine, deployment on Heroku via Flask.
