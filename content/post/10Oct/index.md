It's been awhile since I last posted. Been busy with new job and finally made some time to learn more about Google Cloud. It's the second season of #MajulahGCP. It is a self study Machine Learning and Data Analytics on Google Cloud Platform. Upon completion, you'll receive a cool swag pack. So I have completed 6 modules this time round. I actually attempted one module in season 1 however, I didn't make it in time. I was determined to at least complete 6 modules and the [gifts](https://events.withgoogle.com/majulahgcp-learn-data-analytics-using-google-cloud/) are quite attractive.
